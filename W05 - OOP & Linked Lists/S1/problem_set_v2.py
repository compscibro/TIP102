Problem 1: Instantiate an Instance of Player
Step 1: Copy the following code into your IDE.

Step 2: Instantiate an instance of the class Player and store it in a variable named player_one.

The Player object should have the character "Yoshi" and the kart "Super Blooper".
'''

class Player():
	def __init__(self, character, kart):
		self.character = character
		self.kart = kart
		self.items = []

player_one = Player("Yoshi", "Super Blooper")

print(player_one.character) # Yoshi
print(player_one.kart) # Super Blooper
print(player_one.items) # []

'''
Problem 2: Get Player
Step 1: Using the Player class from Problem 1, add the following get_player() method to your
existing code:

def get_player(self):
    return f"{self.character} driving the {self.kart}"

Step 2: Create a second instance of Player in a variable named player_two.

The Player object created should have character "Bowser" and kart "Pirahna Prowler".

Step 3: Use the method get_player() below to print out
"Match: Yoshi driving the Super Blooper vs Bowser driving the Pirahna Prowler".
'''

player_two = Player("Bowser", "Pirahna Prowler")

print(player_two.character) # Bowser
print(player_two.kart) # Pirahna Prowler
print(player_two.items) # []

'''
Problem 3: Update Kart
Players might want to update their choice of kart for their next race.

Update player_one so that their kart is "Dolphin Dasher" instead of its current value,
"Super Blooper".
'''

player_one.kart = "Dolphin Dasher"

print(player_one.get_player()) # Yoshi driving the Dolphin Dasher

'''
Problem 4: Set Character
In the previous exercise, we accessed and modified a player's kart attribute directly. Instead
of allowing users to update their player directly, it is common to create setter methods that
users can call to update class attributes. This has a few different benefits, including allowing
us to validate data before updating our class instance.

Update your Player class with a method set_character() that takes in one parameter name.

If name is valid, it should update the player's character attribute to have value name and print
"Character updated".
Otherwise, it should print out "Invalid character".
Valid character names are "Mario", "Luigi", "Peach", "Yoshi", "Toad", "Wario",
"Donkey Kong", and "Bowser".
'''

class Player():
	def __init__(self, character, kart):
		self.character = character
		self.kart = kart
		self.items = []

	def set_character(self, name):
		pass

player_three = Player("Donkey Kong", "Standard Kart")

player_three.set_character("Peach") # Character Updated
print(player_three.character) # Peach
player_three.set_character("Baby Peach") # Invalid Character
print(player_three.character) # Peach

'''
Problem 5: Add Special Item
Players can pick up special items as they race.

Update the Player class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the player's items attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
item_name is valid if it has one of the following values: "banana", "green shell",
"red shell", "bob-omb", "super star", "lightning", "bullet bill".
'''

class Player():
	def __init__(self, character, kart):
		self.character = character
		self.kart = kart
		self.items = []

	def add_item(self, item_name):
		pass

player_one = Player("Yoshi", "Dolphin Dasher")

print(player_one.items) # []

player_one.add_item("red shell")
print(player_one.items) # ['red shell']

player_one.add_item("super star")
print(player_one.items) # ['red shell', 'super star']

player_one.add_item("super smash")
print(player_one.items) # ['red shell', 'super star']

'''
Problem 6: Print Inventory
Update the Player class with a method print_inventory() that accepts no parameters except for
self.

The method should print the name and quantity of each item in a player's items list.

If the player has no items, the function should print "Inventory empty".
'''

class Player():
	# ... methods from previous problems

	def print_inventory(self):
		pass

player_one = Player("Yoshi", "Super Blooper")
player_one.items = ["banana", "bob-omb", "banana", "super star"]
player_two = Player("Peach", "Dolphin Dasher")

player_one.print_inventory() # Inventory: banana: 2, bob-omb: 1, super star: 1
player_two.print_inventory() # Inventory empty

'''
Problem 7: Race Results
Given a list race_results of Player objects where the first player in the list came first in
the race, second player in the list came second, etc., write a function print_results() that
prints the players in place.
'''

class Player:
	def __init__(self, character, kart):
		self.character = character
		self.kart = kart
		self.items = []
	# ... methods from previous problems

def print_results(race_results):
	pass

peach = Player("Peach", "Daytripper")
mario = Player("Mario", "Standard Kart M")
luigi = Player("Luigi", "Super Blooper")
race_one = [peach, mario, luigi]

print_results(race_one)
# 1. Peach
# 2. Mario
# 3. Luigi

'''
Problem 8: Get Rank
The Player class has been updated below with a new attribute ahead to represent the player
currently directly ahead of them in the race.

Write a function get_rank() that accepts a Player object my_player and returns their current
place number in the race.
'''

class Player:
	def __init__(self, character, kart, opponent=None):
		self.character = character
		self.kart = kart
		self.items = []
		self.ahead = opponent

def get_rank(my_player):
	pass

peach = Player("Peach", "Daytripper")
mario = Player("Mario", "Standard Kart M", peach)
luigi = Player("Luigi", "Super Blooper", mario)

print(get_rank(luigi)) # 3
print(get_rank(peach)) # 1
print(get_rank(mario)) # 2

'''
Problem 9: Tom and Jerry
A linked list is a new data type that, similar to a normal list or array, allows us to store
pieces of data sequentially. The difference between a linked list and a normal list lies in how
each element is stored in a computer's memory.

In a normal list, individual elements of the list are stored in adjacent memory locations
according to the order they appear in the list. If we know where the first element of the list
is stored, it's really easy to find any other element in the list.

In a linked list, the individual elements called nodes are not stored in sequential memory
locations. Each node may be stored in an unrelated memory location. To connect nodes together
into a sequential list, each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

Using the provided Node class below, create a linked list cat -> mouse where the instance cat
has value "Tom" which points to the instance mouse that has value "Jerry".
'''

class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

cat = Node("Tom")
mouse = Node("Jerry")
cat.next = mouse

print(cat.value) # Tom
print(cat.next) # <__main__.Node object at 0x...>
print(cat.next.value) # Jerry
print(mouse.value) # Jerry
print(mouse.next) # None

'''
Problem 10: Chase List
In a linked list, pointers can be redirected at any place in the list.

Using the linked list from Problem 9, create a new Node dog with value "Spike" and point it to
the cat node so that the full list now looks like dog -> cat -> mouse.
'''

dog = Node("Spike")
dog.next = cat

print(dog.value) # Spike
print(dog.next) # <__main__.Node object at 0x...>
print(dog.next.value) # Tom
print(cat.next) # <__main__.Node object at 0x...>
print(cat.next.value) # Jerry
print(mouse.next) # None

'''
Problem 11: Update Chase
Using the linked list from Problem 10, remove the dog node and add in a node cheese with value
"Gouda" to the end of the list so that the resulting list is cat -> mouse -> cheese.
'''

class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

dog.next = None
cheese = Node("Gouda")
mouse.next = cheese

'''
Problem 12: Chase String
Write a function chase_list() that takes in the head of a linked list and returns a string
linking together the values of the list with the separator "chases".

Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list, equivalent to lst[0]
of a normal list.
'''

def chase_list(head):
	pass

dog = Node("Spike")
cat = Node("Tom")
mouse = Node("Jerry")
cheese = Node("Gouda")

dog.next = cat
cat.next = mouse
mouse.next = cheese

print(chase_list(dog)) # Spike chases Tom chases Jerry chases Gouda
