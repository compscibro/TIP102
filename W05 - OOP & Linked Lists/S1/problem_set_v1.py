'''
Problem 1: New Horizons
Step 1: Copy the following code into your IDE.

Step 2: Instantiate an instance of the class Villager, which represents characters in Animal
Crossing. Store the instance in a variable named apollo.

The Villager object created should have the name "Apollo", the species "Eagle", and the
catchphrase "pah".
'''

class Villager:
	def __init__(self, name, species, catchphrase):
		self.name = name
		self.species = species
		self.catchphrase = catchphrase
		self.furniture = []

apollo = Villager("Apollo", "Eagle", "pah")

print(apollo.name) # Apollo
print(apollo.species) # Eagle
print(apollo.catchphrase) # pah
print(apollo.furniture) # []

'''
Problem 2: Greet Player
Step 1: Using the Villager class from Problem 1, add the following greet_player() method to
your existing code:

def greet_player(self, player_name):
    return f"{self.name}: Hey there, {player_name}! How's it going, {self.catchphrase}!"

Step 2: Create a second instance of Villager in a variable named bones.

The Villager object created should have name "Bones", species "Dog", and catchphrase "yip yip".

Step 3: Call the method greet_player() with your name and print out
"Bones: Hey there, <your name>! How's it going, yip yip!". For example, if your name is Tram,
"Bones: Hey there, Tram! How's it going, yip yip?" would be printed out to the console.
'''

bones = Villager("Bones", "Dog", "yip yip")

'''
Problem 3: Update Catchphrase
In Animal Crossing, as players become friends with villagers, the villagers might ask the player
to suggest a new catchphrase.

Adding on to your existing code, update bones so that his catchphrase is "ruff it up" instead
of its current value, "yip yip".
'''

bones.catchphrase = "ruff it up"

print(bones.greet_player("Samia")) # Bones: Hey there, Samia! How's it going, ruff it up!

'''
Problem 4: Set Character
In the previous exercise, we accessed and modified a player's catchphrase attribute directly.
Instead of allowing users to update their player directly, it is common to create setter methods
that users can call to update class attributes. This has a few different benefits, including
allowing us to validate data before updating our class instance.

Update your Villager class with a method set_catchphrase() that takes in one parameter
new_catchphrase.

If new_catchphrase is valid, it should update the villager's catchphrase attribute to have
value new_catchphrase and print "Catchphrase updated".
Otherwise, it should print out "Invalid catchphrase".
Valid catchphrases are less than 20 characters in length. They must all contain only alphabetic
and whitespace characters.
'''

class Villager:
	def __init__(self, name, species, catchphrase):
		self.name = name
		self.species = species
		self.catchphrase = catchphrase
		self.furniture = []

	def set_catchphrase(self, new_catchphrase):
		pass

alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "guvnor")

alice.set_catchphrase("sweet dreams") # Catchphrase Updated!
print(alice.catchphrase) # sweet dreams
alice.set_catchphrase("#?!") # Invalid catchphrase
print(alice.catchphrase) # sweet dreams

'''
Problem 5: Add Furniture
Players and villagers in Animal Crossing can add furniture to their inventory to decorate their
house.

Update the Villager class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the player's furniture attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
item_name is valid if it has one of the following values: "acoustic guitar",
"ironwood kitchenette", "rattan armchair", "kotatsu", or "cacao tree".
'''

class Villager:
	# ... methods from previous problems

	def add_item(self, item_name):
		pass

alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "guvnor")
print(alice.furniture) # []

alice.add_item("acoustic guitar")
print(alice.furniture) # ["acoustic guitar"]

alice.add_item("cacao tree")
print(alice.furniture) # ["acoustic guitar", "cacao tree"]

alice.add_item("nintendo switch")
print(alice.furniture) # ["acoustic guitar", "cacao tree"]

'''
Problem 6: Print Inventory
Update the Villager class with a method print_inventory() that accepts no parameters except
for self.

The method should print the name and quantity of each item in a villager's furniture list.

The name and quantity should be in the format
"item1: quantity, item2: quantity, item3: quantity" for however many unique items exist in the
villager's furniture list.
If the player has no items, the function should print "Inventory empty".
'''

class Villager():
	# ... methods from previous problems

	def print_inventory(self):
		pass

alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "guvnor")

alice.print_inventory() # Inventory empty

alice.furniture = ["acoustic guitar", "ironwood kitchenette", "kotatsu", "kotatsu"]
alice.print_inventory() # acoustic guitar: 1, ironwood kitchenette: 1, kotatsu: 2

'''
Problem 7: Group by Personality
The Villager class has been updated below to include the new string attribute personality
representing the character's personality type.

Outside of the Villager class, write a function of_personality_type(). Given a list of Villager
instances townies and a string personality_type as parameters, return a list containing the
names of all villagers in townies with personality personality_type. Return the names in any
order.
'''

class Villager:
	def __init__(self, name, species, personality, catchphrase):
		self.name = name
		self.species = species
		self.personality = personality
		self.catchphrase = catchphrase
		self.furniture = []
	# ... methods from previous problems

def of_personality_type(townies, personality_type):
	pass

isabelle = Villager("Isabelle", "Dog", "Normal", "what's up?")
bob = Villager("Bob", "Cat", "Lazy", "pthhhpth")
stitches = Villager("Stitches", "Cub", "Lazy", "stuffin'")

print(of_personality_type([isabelle, bob, stitches], "Lazy")) # ['Bob', 'Stitches']
print(of_personality_type([isabelle, bob, stitches], "Cranky")) # []

'''
Problem 8: Telephone
The Villager constructor has been updated to include an additional attribute neighbor. A
villager's neighbor is another Villager instance and represents their closest neighbor. By
default, a Villager's neighbor is set to None.

Given two Villager instances start_villager and target_villager, write a function
message_received() that returns True if you can pass a message from the start_villager to the
target_villager through a series of neighbors and False otherwise.
'''

class Villager:
	def __init__(self, name, species, personality, catchphrase, neighbor=None):
		self.name = name
		self.species = species
		self.personality = personality
		self.catchphrase = catchphrase
		self.furniture = []
		self.neighbor = neighbor
	# ... methods from previous problems

def message_received(start_villager, target_villager):
	pass

isabelle = Villager("Isabelle", "Dog", "Normal", "what's up?")
tom_nook = Villager("Tom Nook", "Raccoon", "Cranky", "yes, yes")
kk_slider = Villager("K.K. Slider", "Dog", "Lazy", "dig it")
isabelle.neighbor = tom_nook
tom_nook.neighbor = kk_slider

print(message_received(isabelle, kk_slider)) # True
print(message_received(kk_slider, isabelle)) # False

'''
Problem 9: Nook's Cranny
A linked list is a new data type that, similar to a normal list or array, allows us to store
pieces of data sequentially. The difference between a linked list and a normal list lies in how
each element is stored in a computer's memory.

In a normal list, individual elements of the list are stored in adjacent memory locations
according to the order they appear in the list. If we know where the first element of the list
is stored, it's really easy to find any other element in the list.

In a linked list, the individual elements called nodes are not stored in sequential memory
locations. Each node may be stored in an unrelated memory location. To connect nodes together
into a sequential list, each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

Using the provided Node class below, create a linked list Tom Nook -> Tommy where the instance
tom_nook has value "Tom Nook" which points to the instance tommy that has value "Tommy".
'''

class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

tom_nook = Node("Tom Nook")
tommy = Node("Tommy")
tom_nook.next = tommy

print(tom_nook.value) # Tom Nook
print(tom_nook.next.value) # Tommy
print(tommy.value) # Tommy
print(tommy.next) # None

'''
Problem 10: Timmy and Tommy
In a linked list, pointers can be redirected to any place in the list.

Using the linked list from Problem 9, create a new Node timmy with value "Timmy" and place it
between tom_nook and tommy so the new linked list is tom_nook -> timmy -> tommy.
'''

timmy = Node("Timmy")
timmy.next = tommy
tom_nook.next = timmy

print(tom_nook.value) # Tom Nook
print(tom_nook.next.value) # Timmy
print(timmy.value) # Timmy
print(timmy.next.value) # Tommy
print(tommy.value) # Tommy
print(tommy.next) # None

'''
Problem 11: Saharah
Using the linked list from Problem 10, remove the tom_nook node and add in a node saharah with
value "Saharah" to the end of the list so that the resulting list is timmy -> tommy -> saharah.
'''

class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

tom_nook.next = None
saharah = Node("Saharah")
tommy.next = saharah

print(tom_nook.next) # None
print(timmy.value) # Timmy
print(timmy.next.value) # Tommy
print(tommy.value) # Tommy
print(tommy.next.value) # Saharah
print(saharah.value) # Saharah
print(saharah.next) # None

'''
Problem 12: Print Players Linked List
Write a function print_list() that takes in the head of a linked list and returns a string
linking together the values of the list with the separator "->".

Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list. Equivalent to lst[0]
of a normal list.
'''

def print_list(head):
	pass

isabelle = Node("Isabelle")
saharah = Node("Saharah")
cj = Node("C.J.")

isabelle.next = saharah
saharah.next = cj

print(print_list(isabelle)) # Isabelle -> Saharah -> C.J.
