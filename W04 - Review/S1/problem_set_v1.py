Problem 1: NFT Name Extractor
You're curating a large collection of NFTs for a digital art gallery, and your first task is
to extract the names of these NFTs from a given list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the
list represents an NFT, and contains information such as the name, creator, and current value.

Write the extract_nft_names() function, which takes in this list and returns a list of all
NFT names.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a
rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

	{"name": "Golden Hour", "creator": "SunsetArtist", "value": 8.9}
]

'''
Problem 2: NFT Collection Review
You're responsible for ensuring the quality of the NFT collection before it is displayed in
the virtual gallery. One of your tasks is to review and debug the code that extracts the
names of NFTs from the collection. A junior developer wrote the initial version of this
function, but it contains some bugs that prevent it from working correctly.

Task:
- Review the provided code and identify the bug(s).
- Explain what the bug is and how it affects the output.
- Refactor the code to fix the bug(s) and provide the correct implementation.

Problem 3: Identify Popular Creators
You have been tasked with identifying the most popular NFT creators in your collection. A
creator is considered "popular" if they have created more than one NFT in the collection.

Write the identify_popular_creators() function, which takes a list of NFTs and returns a
list of the names of popular creators.

rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

'''
Problem 4: NFT Collection Statistics
You want to provide an overview of the NFT collection to potential buyers. One key statistic
is the average value of the NFTs in the collection. However, if the collection is empty, the
average value should be reported as 0.

Write the average_nft_value() function, which calculates and returns the average value of
the NFTs in the collection.

rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

'''
Problem 5: NFT Tag Search
Some NFTs are grouped into collections, and each collection might contain multiple NFTs.
Additionally, each NFT can have a list of tags describing its style or theme (e.g.,
"abstract", "landscape", "modern"). You need to search through these nested collections to
find all NFTs that contain a specific tag.

Write the search_nft_by_tag() function, which takes in a nested list of NFT collections and
a tag to search for. The function should return a list of NFT names that have the specified
tag.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a
rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

'''
Problem 6: NFT Queue Processing
NFTs are processed in a queue that follows First-In, First-Out (FIFO). Given a list of NFT
names in their initial queue order, return the order in which they are processed.

Write the process_nft_queue() function, which takes a list of NFTs. The function should
return a list of NFT names in the order they were processed.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a
rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

process_nft_queue(nft_queue_3) # ['Crypto Kitty', 'Galactic Voyage']

'''
Problem 7: Validate NFT Addition
You want to ensure that NFTs are added in a balanced way. For example, every "add" action
must be properly closed by a corresponding "remove" action.

Write the validate_nft_actions() function, which takes a list of actions (either "add" or
"remove") and returns True if the actions are balanced, and False otherwise.

A sequence of actions is considered balanced if every "add" has a corresponding "remove" and
no "remove" occurs before an "add".

rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

actions_3 = ["add", "remove", "remove", "add"]
validate_nft_actions(actions_3) # False

'''
Problem 8: Find Closest NFT Values
Buyers often look for NFTs that are closest in value to their budget. Given a sorted list of
NFT values and a budget, you need to find the two NFT values that are closest to the given
budget: one that is just below or equal to the budget and one that is just above or equal to
the budget. If an exact match exists, it should be included as one of the values.

Write the find_closest_nft_values() function, which takes a sorted list of NFT values and a
budget, and returns the pair of the two closest NFT values.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a
rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
