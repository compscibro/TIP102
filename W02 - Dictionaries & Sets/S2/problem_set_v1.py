Problem 1: Most Endangered Species
Imagine you are working on a wildlife conservation database. Write a function named
most_endangered() that returns the species with the highest conservation priority based on
its population.

The function should take in a list of dictionaries named species_list as a parameter. Each
dictionary represents data associated with a species, including its name, habitat, and wild
population. The function should return the name of the species with the lowest population.

If there are multiple species with the lowest population, return the species with the lowest
index.
'''

def most_endangered(species_list):
	pass

species_list = [
	{"name": "Amur Leopard", "habitat": "Temperate forests", "population": 84},
	{"name": "Javan Rhino", "habitat": "Tropical forests", "population": 72},
	{"name": "Vaquita", "habitat": "Marine", "population": 10}
]
most_endangered(species_list) # "Vaquita"

'''
Problem 2: Identifying Endangered Species
As part of conservation efforts, certain species are considered endangered and are represented
by the string endangered_species. Each character in this string denotes a different endangered
species. You also have a record of all observed species in a particular region, represented by
the string observed_species. Each character in observed_species denotes a species observed in
the region.

Your task is to determine how many instances of the observed species are also considered
endangered.

Note: Species are case-sensitive, so "a" is considered a different species from "A".
'''

def count_endangered_species(endangered_species, observed_species):
	pass

endangered_species1 = "aA"
observed_species1 = "aAAbbbb"
count_endangered_species(endangered_species1, observed_species1) # 3

endangered_species2 = "z"
observed_species2 = "ZZ"
count_endangered_species(endangered_species2, observed_species2) # 0

'''
Problem 3: Navigating the Research Station
In a wildlife research station, each letter of the alphabet represents a different observation
point laid out in a single row. Given a string station_layout of length 26 indicating the
layout of these observation points (indexed from 0 to 25), you start your journey at the
first observation point (index 0). To make observations in a specific order represented by a
string observations, you need to move from one point to another.

The time taken to move from one observation point to another is the absolute difference
between their indices, |i - j|.

Write a function that returns the total time it takes to visit all the required observation
points in the given order with one movement.
'''

def navigate_research_station(station_layout, observations):
	pass

station_layout1 = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno"
observations1 = "wildlife"
navigate_research_station(station_layout1, observations1) # 45

station_layout2 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
observations2 = "cba"
navigate_research_station(station_layout2, observations2) # 4

'''
Problem 4: Prioritizing Endangered Species Observations
In your work with a wildlife conservation database, you have two lists: observed_species and
priority_species. The elements of priority_species are distinct, and all elements in
priority_species are also in observed_species.

Write a function prioritize_observations() that sorts the elements of observed_species such
that the relative ordering of items in observed_species matches that of priority_species.
Species that do not appear in priority_species should be placed at the end of observed_species
in ascending order.
'''

def prioritize_observations(observed_species, priority_species):
	pass

observed_species1 = ["🐯", "🦁", "🦌", "🦁", "🐯", "🐘", "🐍", "🦑", "🐻", "🐯", "🐼"]
priority_species1 = ["🐯", "🦌", "🐘", "🦁"]
prioritize_observations(observed_species1, priority_species1)
# ["🐯", "🐯", "🐯", "🦌", "🐘", "🦁", "🦁", "🐍", "🐻", "🐼", "🦑"]

observed_species2 = ["bluejay", "sparrow", "cardinal", "robin", "crow"]
priority_species2 = ["cardinal", "sparrow", "bluejay"]
prioritize_observations(observed_species2, priority_species2)
# ["cardinal", "sparrow", "bluejay", "crow", "robin"]

'''
Problem 5: Calculating Conservation Statistics
You are given a 0-indexed integer array species_populations of even length, where each
element represents the population of a particular species in a wildlife reserve.

As long as species_populations is not empty, you must repetitively:
- Find the species with the minimum population and remove it.
- Find the species with the maximum population and remove it.
- Calculate the average population of the two removed species: (a + b) / 2.

Return the number of distinct averages calculated using the above process.

Note that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum population, any can be removed.
'''

def distinct_averages(species_populations):
	pass

species_populations1 = [4, 1, 4, 0, 3, 5]
distinct_averages(species_populations1) # 2

species_populations2 = [1, 100]
distinct_averages(species_populations2) # 1

'''
Problem 6: Wildlife Reintroduction
As a conservationist, your research center has been raising multiple endangered species and
is now ready to reintroduce them into their native habitats. You are given two 0-indexed
strings raised_species and target_species. The string raised_species represents the list of
species available to release into the wild at your center, where each character represents a
different species. The string target_species represents a specific sequence of species you
want to form and release together.

You can take some species from raised_species and rearrange them to form new sequences.

Return the maximum number of copies of target_species that can be formed by taking species
from raised_species and rearranging them.
'''

def max_species_copies(raised_species, target_species):
	pass

raised_species1 = "abcba"
target_species1 = "abc"
max_species_copies(raised_species1, target_species1) # 1

raised_species2 = "aaaaabbbbcc"
target_species2 = "abc"
max_species_copies(raised_species2, target_species2) # 2

'''
Problem 7: Count Unique Species
You are given a string ecosystem_data that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
The digits represent the observed counts of various species in a protected ecosystem.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "f123de34g8hi34" will
become " 123  34 8  34". Notice that you are left with some species counts that are separated
by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".

Return the number of unique species counts after performing the replacement operations on
ecosystem_data.

Two species counts are considered different if their decimal representations without any
leading zeros are different.
'''

def count_unique_species(ecosystem_data):
	pass

ecosystem_data1 = "f123de34g8hi34"
count_unique_species(ecosystem_data1) # 3

ecosystem_data2 = "species1234forest234"
count_unique_species(ecosystem_data2) # 2

ecosystem_data3 = "x1y01z001"
count_unique_species(ecosystem_data3) # 1

'''
Problem 8: Equivalent Species Pairs
In an effort to understand species diversity in different habitats, researchers are analyzing
species pairs observed in various regions. Each pair is represented by a list [a, b] where
a and b represent two species observed together.

A species pair [a, b] is considered equivalent to another pair [c, d] if and only if either
(a == c and b == d) or (a == d and b == c). This means that the order of species in a pair
does not matter.

Your task is to determine the number of equivalent species pairs in the list of observed
species pairs.

def num_equiv_species_pairs(species_pairs):
	pass

species_pairs1 = [[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

species_pairs2 = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]]
