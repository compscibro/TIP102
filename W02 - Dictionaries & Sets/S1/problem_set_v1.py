Problem 1: Festival Lineup
Given two lists of strings artists and set_times of length n, write a function lineup() that
maps each artist to their set time.

An artist artists[i] has set time set_times[i]. Assume 0 <= i < n and
len(artists) == len(set_times).
'''

def lineup(artists, set_times):
	pass

artists1 = ["Kendrick Lamar", "Chappell Roan", "Mitski", "Rosalia"]
set_times1 = ["9:30 PM", "5:00 PM", "2:00 PM", "7:30 PM"]
lineup(artists1, set_times1)
# {"Kendrick Lamar": "9:30 PM", "Chappell Roan": "5:00 PM", "Mitski": "2:00 PM", "Rosalia": "7:30 PM"}

artists2 = []
set_times2 = []

'''
Problem 2: Planning App
You are designing an app for your festival to help attendees have the best experience possible!
As part of the application, users will be able to easily search their favorite artist and find
out the day, time, and stage the artist is playing at. Write a function get_artist_info() that
accepts a string artist and a dictionary festival_schedule mapping artist names to dictionaries
containing the day, time, and stage they are playing on. Return the dictionary containing the
information about the given artist.

If the artist searched for does not exist in festival_schedule, return the dictionary
{"message": "Artist not found"}.
'''

def get_artist_info(artist, festival_schedule):
	pass

festival_schedule = {
	"Blood Orange": {"day": "Friday", "time": "9:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"},

get_artist_info("Blood Orange", festival_schedule)
# {'day': 'Friday', 'time': '9:00 PM', 'stage': 'Main Stage'}

get_artist_info("Taylor Swift", festival_schedule) # {'message': 'Artist not found'}

'''
Problem 3: Ticket Sales
A dictionary ticket_sales is used to map ticket type to number of tickets sold. Return the
total number of tickets of all types sold.
'''

def total_sales(ticket_sales):
	pass

ticket_sales = {"Friday": 200, "Saturday": 1000, "Sunday": 800, "3-Day Pass": 2500}
total_sales(ticket_sales) # 4500

'''
Problem 4: Scheduling Conflict
Demand for your festival has exceeded expectations, so you're expanding the festival to span
two different venues. Some artists will perform at both venues, while others will perform at
just one. To ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts, implement a function
identify_conflicts() that accepts two dictionaries venue1_schedule and venue2_schedule each
mapping the artists playing at the venue to their set times. Return a dictionary containing
the key-value pairs that are the same in each schedule.
'''

def identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule):
	pass

venue1_schedule = {
	"Stromae": "9:00 PM",
	"Janelle Monáe": "8:00 PM",
	"HARDY": "7:00 PM",
	"Bruce Springsteen": "6:00 PM"
}

venue2_schedule = {
	"Stromae": "9:00 PM",
	"Janelle Monáe": "10:30 PM",
	"HARDY": "7:00 PM",
	"Wizkid": "6:00 PM"
}

identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule) # {"Stromae": "9:00 PM", "HARDY": "7:00 PM"}

'''
Problem 5: Best Set
As part of the festival, attendees cast votes for their favorite set. Given a dictionary votes
that maps attendee id numbers to the artist they voted for, return the artist that had the
highest number of votes. If there is a tie, return any artist with the top number of votes.
'''

def best_set(votes):
	pass

votes1 = {
	1234: "SZA",
	1235: "Yo-Yo Ma",
	1236: "Ethel Cain",
	1237: "Ethel Cain",
	1238: "SZA",
	1239: "SZA"

	1237: "Ethel Cain",
	1238: "SZA"
}
best_set(votes2) # "SZA" or "Ethel Cain" (tie — either is acceptable)

'''
Problem 6: Performances with Maximum Audience
You are given an array audiences consisting of positive integers representing the audience
size for different performances at a music festival.

Return the combined size of every audience that had the maximum size.

The audience size of a performance is the number of people who attended that performance.
'''

def max_audience_performances(audiences):
	pass

audiences1 = [100, 200, 200, 150, 100, 250]

audiences2 = [120, 180, 220, 150, 220]
max_audience_performances(audiences2) # 440

'''
Problem 7: Performances with Maximum Audience II
If you used a dictionary as part of your solution to max_audience_performances() in the
previous problem, try reimplementing the function without using a dictionary. If you
implemented max_audience_performances() without using a dictionary, try solving the problem
with a dictionary.

Once you've come up with your second solution, compare the two. Is one solution better than
the other? Why or why not?
'''

def max_audience_performances(audiences):
	pass

audiences1 = [100, 200, 200, 150, 100, 250]

audiences2 = [120, 180, 220, 150, 220]
max_audience_performances(audiences2) # 440

'''
Problem 8: Popular Song Pairs
Given an array of integers popularity_scores representing the popularity scores of songs in a
music festival playlist, return the number of popular song pairs.

A pair (i, j) is called popular if the songs have the same popularity score and i < j.

Hint: number of pairs = (n * (n-1)) / 2
'''

def num_popular_pairs(popularity_scores):
	pass

'''
Problem 9: Stage Arrangement Difference Between Two Performances
You are given two lists of strings s and t representing the stage arrangements of performers
in two different performances at a music festival, such that every performer occurs at most
once in s and t, and t is a permutation of s.

The stage arrangement difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute
difference between the index of the occurrence of each performer in s and the index of the
occurrence of the same performer in t.

Return the stage arrangement difference between s and t.

A permutation is a rearrangement of a sequence. For example, [3, 1, 2] and [2, 1, 3] are
both permutations of the list [1, 2, 3].

Hint: Use the built-in abs() function for absolute value.
'''

def find_stage_arrangement_difference(s, t):
	pass

s1 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
t1 = ["Bob", "Alice", "Charlie"]

t2 = ["Eve", "David", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie"]
find_stage_arrangement_difference(s2, t2) # 12

'''
Problem 10: VIP Passes and Guests
You're given strings vip_passes representing the types of guests that have VIP passes, and
guests representing the guests you have at the music festival. Each character in guests is a
type of guest you have. You want to know how many of the guests you have are also VIP pass
holders.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of guest from "A".

Here is the pseudocode for the problem. Implement this in Python and explain your
implementation step-by-step.

1. Create an empty set called vip_set.
2. For each character in vip_passes, add it to vip_set.
3. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
4. For each character in guests:
   * If the character is in vip_set, increment the count by 1.
5. Return the count.
'''

def num_VIP_guests(vip_passes, guests):
	pass

vip_passes1 = "aA"
guests1 = "aAAbbbb"

vip_passes2 = "z"
guests2 = "ZZ"
num_VIP_guests(vip_passes2, guests2) # 0

'''
Problem 11: Performer Schedule Pattern
Given a string pattern and a string schedule, return True if schedule follows the same
pattern. Return False otherwise.

Here, "follow" means a full match, such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a
letter in pattern and a non-empty word in schedule.

You are provided with a partially implemented and buggy version of the solution. Identify and
fix the bugs in the code. Then, perform a thorough code review and suggest improvements.
'''

'''
Problem 12: Sort the Performers
You are given an array of strings performer_names, and an array performance_times that
consists of distinct positive integers representing the performance durations in minutes.
Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, performer_names[i] and performance_times[i] denote the name and
performance duration of the ith performer.

Return performer_names sorted in descending order by the performance durations.
